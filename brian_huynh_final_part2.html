Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?
I built most of the portfolio of my website from scratch.

How taking this class changed your view on Web Development? 
It's a lot more time consuming and assignment-heavy than I realized, even though the concepts themselves are very simple. 

What would you recommend to future students taking this class?
For future students, I would recommend them to be programming as soon as they recieve the assignments in this class. Even though you can copy and paste
with some assignments and some parts of the code, it is not something which you can breeze through quickly. Take the time to program everything, and really
learn to read the code.
