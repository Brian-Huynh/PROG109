<!--What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript? -->
I had no previous knowledge of HTM and CSS, but only did a little bit of Javascript around middle school a long while ago. 
Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?
I built most of the portfolio on my website from scratch. 


<!-- What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.) -->
I think the hardest part was the both HTML and CSS when constructing the website. There's a lot of tiny details in the code that you really have to dig through and see why the website
doesn't display the way it does. It's a lot of just going back and forth, which is time consuming.


<!--How taking this class changed your view on Web Development? -->
It's a lot more time consuming and assignment-heavy than I realized, even though the concepts themselves are very simple. 


<!--What would you recommend to future students taking this class? -->
For future students, I would recommend them to be programming as soon as they recieve the assignments in this class. Even though you can copy and paste
with some assignments and some parts of the code, it is not something which you can breeze through quickly. Take the time to program everything, and really
learn to read the code.
