    <p> What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript? <br /> </p>
    <p> I had no previous knowledge of HTM and CSS, but only did a little bit of Javascript around middle school a long while ago. <br /> </p>

    <p> Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch? <br /> </p>
    <p> I built the portfolio on my website from scratch using HTML and CSS. <br /> </p>

    <p> What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.) </p>
    <p> I think the hardest part was the both HTML and CSS when constructing the website. There's a lot of tiny details in the code that you really have to dig through and see why the website doesn't display the way it does. It's a lot of just going back and forth, which is time consuming. <br /> </p>

    <p> How taking this class changed your view on Web Development? <br /> </p>
    <p> At first, I thought web development would be very hard, since I've seen and heard of so many concepts and processes involved in coding. Taking this class made me realized that it's not that hard, it's just a lot more time consuming and assignment-heavy than I realized, even though the concepts themselves are very simple. <br /> </p>

    <p> What would you recommend to future students taking this class? <br /></p>
    For future students, I would recommend them to be programming as soon as they recieve the assignments in this class. Even though you can copy and pastewith some assignments using some parts of given code, overall it is not something which you can breeze through quickly. </p>
