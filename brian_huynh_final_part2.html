    <p> What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript? <br /> </p>
    <p> I had no previous knowledge of HTM and CSS, but only did a little bit of basic Javascript around middle school a long while ago. Other than that, I have no experience with using any of these languages <br /> </p>

    <p> Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch? <br /> </p>
    <p> I built the portfolio on my website from scratch using HTML and CSS. <br /> </p>

    <p> What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.) </p>
    <p> I think the hardest part of my portfolio was handling and writing the HTML and CSS when constructing the website portfolio, and other programming assignments like artifacts in general. There's a lot of tiny details in the code that you really have to dig through and see why the website doesn't display the way it does. It's a lot of just going back and forth across 7-8 pages just to make sure it displays right, which is very time consuming. <br /> </p>

    <p> How taking this class changed your view on Web Development? <br /> </p>
    <p> At first, I thought web development would be very hard, since I've seen and heard of so many concepts and processes involved in coding, and it was pretty intimidating. Taking this class made me realized that it's not that hard, it's just a lot more time consuming and assignment-heavy than I realized, even though the concepts themselves are very simple. Also, a lot more memorization  <br /> </p>

    <p> What would you recommend to future students taking this class? <br /></p>
    For future students, I would recommend them to be programming as soon as they recieve the assignments in this class and to really learn how to type out everything in programming. Even though you can copy and paste parts of the code with some assignments using parts of a given code, ultimately it will be up to them to be able to both edit and revise the code on their own. Overall, it is not something which you can breeze through quickly. </p>
