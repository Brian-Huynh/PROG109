      <h2> <a  href="https://www2.bellevuecollege.edu/classes/All/MATH%26/141" target="_blank">  Pre-Calculus I </a> </h2>
      <p> I knew Geometry and Algebra before the class, so I was already pretty familiar with how to do a fair amount of math when I took this class. Here, I learned more in-depth about different kinds of functions (exponential, inverse, parabolas, etc.), how to graphing, and solve or simplify them. </p>

    <div class="course">
      <h2> <a href="https://www2.bellevuecollege.edu/classes/All/MUSC/107" target="_blank"> Music Fundamentals</a> </h2>
      <p> Before I took the class, I had little understanding of how music was made or basic theory. After I took the class, I learned how to arrange music and read notes through notation, idenitfy beat and rhythm pattern. </p>

    <div class="course">
      <h2> <a href="https://www.bellevuecollege.edu/classes/All/PROG/109"> Web Development </a> </h2>
      <p> One of the classes I'm currently taking. Before, I did very little programming and only had a vague understanding of how programming works and some basic concepts. With this class, I'm learning to use prgramming languages HTML, CSS, and Javascrpt and how to build websites like the one you're currently on! </p>
